1. position: absolute lets you place the object at a specific place in relation to its parent element.
It is not affected by other elements on the page.
position: fixed lets you place an element in relation to the wievport.
This will not be affected when scrolling for example.
The difference between these two are the position they are relative to. One is relative to its parent element, and the other is the viewport.

2. parent-element:nth-child(3){};
