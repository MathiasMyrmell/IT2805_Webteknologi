                My coding experience is for the most part python and java
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also tried programming with django and react as frameworks, but with no skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript, this have not been very successful.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, my expectations for this course is to proper learn these three languages, so I can further develop my programming skills with proper frameworks.
