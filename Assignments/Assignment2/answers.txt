1. Inline CSS is the most specific, and will override external CSS. The only way to override inline CSS with external CSS, is to use !important.
2. We use .class when there are many occurrences, like <p>. #id is more suitable when we want to change specific objects, like pictures.
3. RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue and Alpha, and it is a colour model. With RGBA, you can represent every colour that can be made with the primary colours, but in addition the alpha value determines the opacity.
4. We include the CSS files in the head element so these files will be loaded before anything else.
5. To ways to reach the specific <p> tags is:
    Al1: article p{…}
    Alt2: article>p{…}
